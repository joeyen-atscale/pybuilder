# pybuilder

**Turn an idea into working, tested Python software** — using Claude Code as your build partner.

You describe what you want to build. pybuilder scaffolds the project, writes the code, tests it,
and won't declare it done until it actually works. Not "it compiled" works — *"it does what you
asked for"* works.

It's designed for people who have a clear idea of what they want, but don't want to spend their
time wiring up boilerplate, writing test harnesses, or second-guessing whether the code is any
good. pybuilder handles all of that.

## What it builds

Three kinds of Python projects:

- **CLI tool** — a command you run in the terminal. Good for automation, file processing,
  data wrangling, scheduled tasks. The fastest thing to build and the best starting point
  if you're not sure which type you need.

- **Library** — reusable code another project imports. Good for shared logic, data models,
  API wrappers.

- **Agent** — a program that reasons and makes decisions, not just executes steps.
  Good for anything that involves language models, multi-step workflows, or adaptive behavior.
  This is pybuilder's specialty.

## How it works

You start with a PRD — a short document describing what you want. If you don't have one yet,
use `/prd-writer` first (it's included). Then you invoke `/pybuilder` in Claude Code.

Behind the scenes, pybuilder runs a loop:

1. **Understand** — extracts your requirements and acceptance criteria from the PRD
2. **Scaffold** — creates the project structure and a locked test harness you can't accidentally break
3. **Build** — writes code in `src/` only, then runs the full quality check
4. **Evaluate** — measures the result across multiple dimensions (not just "did it crash?")
5. **Gate** — an independent review that must pass before anything is declared ready

It won't ship on a green test suite alone. LLM-bearing code behaves differently across runs, so
pybuilder runs the same inputs multiple times and checks for consistency. A flaky result is a
signal that the spec needs sharpening, not that you should ignore it.

## Getting started

**First time?** Start with `/prd-writer`. It helps you turn any idea into the kind of clear
description pybuilder can act on. Takes about ten minutes.

**Have a PRD?** Install everything in one step:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeyen-atscale/pybuilder/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs two Claude Code skills (`/prd-writer` and `/pybuilder`) and the `pybuilder`
command-line tool.

**Then in Claude Code:**
```
/pybuilder path/to/your-prd.md
```

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **git**
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)**

That's it. No Docker, no cloud accounts, no infrastructure to set up.

## A note on Claude

The judge step — where pybuilder does an independent quality review — calls Claude and requires
an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Everything else (scaffold, build, test, audit) runs locally with no
network required. If you don't have a key, the judge step is skipped and pybuilder will tell
you so.
